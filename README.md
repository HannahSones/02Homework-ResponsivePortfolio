# 02Homework-ResponsivePortfolio
Using the Bootstrap CSS Framework, this is a responsive portfolio designed to work across a number of different sized screens.

## About the project
To better understand bootstrap for creating responsive web designs, I have used bootstrap components and grids to create a three-page responsive portfolio. To override the in-built design elements bootstrap provides, I have then created my own CSS file with custom styling for specific elements.

See screenshots of final design below.
